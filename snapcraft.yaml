# 'classis' is required for launcher functionality.
#
# If 'strict' is used everything except launching other apps works.
#   There isn't a way to make launching work with 'strict' confinement.
#
#   Using 'system-files' as a plug to expose bin directories won't work for
#   launching because applications need more than just the bin directory to
#   run. We'd need to expose /etc/, */lib, */share and more. Pretty much the
#   entire file system which defeates the purpose of strict containment.
#
#   Further, the environment in a strict snap is setup for the snap container.
#   Most apps won't be able to run due to the the paths being wrong for them.
